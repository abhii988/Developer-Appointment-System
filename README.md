# Developer-Appointment-System
Developer Appointment System created using Java

The aim of this assessment was to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a system that stores details of the developer platform and to appoint or terminate a senior or junior developer as required using the java programming language. 
It has a simple graphical user interface with functionality like add, appoint and terminate.
The code was written in such a way that it saves the data and entries into an array list but the array is to be created ourselves and is erased when program is terminated.
